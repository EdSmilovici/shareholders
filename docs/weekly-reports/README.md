# Week 9

## Week 8 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

Devestating loss, we scored so low but at least we lost to Devin.

Rough to score low because of this leagues 6th place playoff rule, our points scored is still higher than the bottom 4 so the tie breaker doesn't apply but we need to lock in and put up points even on weeks we lose.

At least we didn't lose to a massive underperformace, Devin's team put up more points than our projection so even an average performance would likely have been a loss. Regardless we lock in for another week.

### Trades

None

## Rosters

This week we face off against Mark, he's in australlia upside down, no way we lose to him, he's asleep when most of the games are on.

## Pick ups and drops

With the eagles on bye we needed to free up some room for another defence.

:heavy_plus_sign: LAR

:heavy_minus_sign: T. Pollard **RB** - TEN

## Injury report

**Ricky Pearsall** Ruled out for week 9, kind of annoying but homefully he heals up to 100 and when he comes back he is right back to high performance.

**Emeka Egbuka** Marked as healthy and played last week but underperformed and is on bye this week, hopefully he rests up for next week.

**Jayden Daniels** Named as this weeks starter and with dak's poor performace last week we might be forced to field him.

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

Two games to watch: Atlanta at 1pm Sunday, we have Drake and Bijon playing for Atlanta and Sunday 8:20 pm for Dak.

-   **Drake London**: Sunday 1pm let's hope all he does is win.
-   **Bijan Robinson**: Poor performace last week hopefully he can lock in and get back into highscore form.
-   **Keenan Allen**: Matt didn't field him last week and he still did poorly, must have been a fluke anyways let's hope he stays benched over there.

### Hate

-   **Kyler Murray**: Mark's qb plays against dallas this week so hopefully Dak destroys this match up Sunday prime time.
-   **Kyler Murphey**: Another Kyler? seems fair that if you hear the name Kyler this weekend it's fair to pray for a drop or something, Sunday 4pm.
-   **Amon-Ra St. Brown**: Off of a bye week hopefully he underperforms against Colin's Vikings Sunday 1pm.

Wrapping it up Mark is someone below us so winning here helps solidify our playoff position.
