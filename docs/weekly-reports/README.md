# Week 11

## Week 10 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

I wait for a sound,

Anything will do.

It must be near bound,

Waiting for a poo.

Another night of me waiting for Rowan to poop. Another week that Julien also takes the shit (a loss) in his current 1-9 streak. I’d say that week was a 🔒. With a score of 147, I’d say our boys did amazing. Our TE McBride has climbed his way into first place TE! Along with our other two power house wide receivers catching receives than humanly possible.

We’re against some random team next week who also has the exact same score as we do :0

Although, they only scored 120 points last week so let’s keep putting our trust in the Burnett lineup 🙏

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

Being posted so late we only have one option to cheer on our GOAT 🐐 DAK PRESCOTT!

-   **DAK PRESCOTT**: BRING IT HOME KING.

### Hate

-   **CeeDee Lamb**: Coming off break please don't be rested and go back to underperforming, i don't need the point in my other league.
-   **Brock Bowers**: probably would have never made it onto out hate watch list but this report is so late he's one of 3 remaining players so please underperform
-   **Dallas**: Okay if ceedee is going to put up points please be because the dallas defence is doing extreamly poorly
