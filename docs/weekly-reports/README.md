# Week 7

## Week 6 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

Wow week 6 went well with a scheduled W.

Big shout outs to our boys Dak (obviously bringing the heat weekly), Robinson (the #3 RB in the NFL), our TE Mr. McBride and our #2 pick in the season D.London who ALL scored above 20 points for us.

The other half of the team dropped the ball, but at least it wasnâ€™t as bad as Mr. Ryan Smiloviciâ€™s team ðŸ‘€

People are talkingâ€¦ is it time to switch out our kicker and defence? Both are #12 ranking in the season so far. Do we love an underdog or maybe we have some insider knowledge?? ðŸ¤” who knows - as long as they keep putting up points, we can keep getting the big wins.

Not to put any pressure, but weâ€™re up against the biggest smack talker in the league- Arian Nabavi. Currently projected to win at 52% AND his weekly average points is 9 points ahead of us ðŸ˜­ Whats the strat boys? Offer him another garbage trade? Go take out his players personally?! Maybe if I see him this week, I can sub out his starting line up?? Sounds like we need a miracle boys..

In other football news, shout out to Ry for getting every single survivor pick correct so far!!! I could never.

Love,

Fresh Prince of 1Knee

## Pick ups and drops

None

## Injury report

**Ricky Pearsall** No participation in practice so far so not looking good.

**Emeka Egbuka** Injured last week, questionable to return but with no participation in practice so far this week it's not looking good, rest up king we'll need you back in 20 point form.

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

-   **Jayden Daniels**: Back in our starting line up he is facing off against Dalas and our benched QB Dak Prescott, hopefully he outperforms him. Sunday 4:25 probably a fun watch to see which of our QBs is truely better.
-   **Bijan Robinson**: 35 points last week, he is still one of our stars that merrit the eyes we put on him.
-   **Drake London**: 31 points last week, another rock star, although his projected doesn't look crazy we hope he get plenty of targets this week agianst the 49ers prime time Sunday night.

### Hate

Arian's made some trades so funny to anti sweat those but he also has a fair share of high projected players who are due for a bad week.

-   **Jonathan Taylor**: projected for 20 points sunday 4:05 against the chargers, let's hope he doesn't get any long runs.
-   **Josh Jacobs**: Two first names?! cannot be trusted, limited in practice thursday hope he feels better but maybe rest up this week. Trade from Mike and Leon, let's pray for an underperformace.
-   **Nico Colins**: A third two first namer?! man arian's whole team can't be trusted, comming off a bye he was part of the devin trade so this will be a funny one if he underperforms.

Overall if Josh and Nico do poorly we'll have plenty of amo to call Arian a bad manager.
