# Week 8

## Week 7 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

Week 7 we faced off against the top ranked team in the league, Arian's team. Good thing we locked in cause we demolished him and he has no excuse for this loss.

The only thing that would have made this victory sweeter would have been if it was his birthday week for another birthday defeat (haha poor Nino) but the week prior will have to do. Early birthday loss for Arian.

Dak locked in and performed above his criminaly low projection. Shout out Matt for benching Keenan Allen and allowing him to greatly over perform (please keep him on the bench or drop him). Lastly happy to see Egbuka back in the line up, although he was clearly being cautious he came close to hitting his projection and will hopefully be back at 100% this week.

### Trades

None

## Rosters

This week we face off against Toe Burrow, 2-5 Devin is projected slightly higher than us but as you all know add at least 5 points to Dak's projection.

## Pick ups and drops

:heavy_plus_sign: N. Chubb RB - HOU

:heavy_minus_sign: K. Monangai RB - CHI

## Injury report

**Ricky Pearsall** No participation in practice so far so not looking good.

**Emeka Egbuka** Played last week but is currently marked as quentionable so he's clearly still dealing with something

**Jayden Daniels** Out this week, hoping he gets back into it for week 9, but Dak's got our Bak.

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

-   **Dak Prescott**: Our back up QB hasn't thrown up insane numbers but has been pretty consistant at beating his projections so we'll take a consistent QB any day!
-   **Bijan Robinson**: 21 points last week, we could use a great performance to lock in a win against devin this week. He playes 1pm Sunday against the dolphins.
-   **Keenan Allen**: Let's hope he stays on Matt bench because it will guarantee a lot of points tonight (thursday) against colin's beloved Vikings.

### Hate

-   **Denver Defence**: Dak faces off against the Denver defence so lets hope he can carve them up Sunday 4pm.
-   **Jamar Chase**: Bengals all star is projected for 20ish points, hopefully the Jets can hold him back Sunday 1pm.
-   **Rachaad White**: Another 20 point projection, how does devin have two players projected higher than Dak?! the projection algorithm must be flawed because no chance he puts up 20 against the Saints 4pm Sunday.

Hate to cheer against Devin because he had an early season injury in Joe Burrow and made two trades that i'd rather razz the traders but we could really use underperformances by the traded players this week.
