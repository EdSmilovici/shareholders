# Week 13

## Week 12 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

Sorry Nino but we needed that win, after a great performace by Dak Prescot we breezed into a clinched playoff spot. Other shout outs go to Bijan, McBride and RJ Harvey for our win.

Facing off against Nedim this week he is likely our round 1 playoff match up as awell so we need to lock in against him. The only scenario where we don't face him is if we win this week and Mike and Leon lose, in which case we face off against Nino again.

Overall a chill week for us as i'm not exactly sure who i'd rather face off in the playoffs

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

Early report so maybe the active line up changes up but for now this is the list

-   **Daddy Dak**: I see he's currently in our active line up, after his great performace last week, let's see a repeat. Sunday 4:30 vs KC
-   **Bijan Robinson**: matched up against the Jets?! should be an easy point night, i actually have no clue how good the jets are doing this year but it usually safe to say they suck. Sunday 1pm @ NYJ
-   **Trey McBride**: projected for 18 let's see our star tight end put up some points Sunday 1pm at tampa bay.

### Hate

Early report so his lineup could change but after losing to Rexxy we can not lose to his dad Nino. Sorry

-   **Lamar Jackson**: Thursday night at Cincinnati, their record is poor but we need to lock in a low scoring game, hopefully lamar doesn't run as much as he usually does.
-   **McCaffrey**: sunday 1pm in cleveland, hate to wish injury on anyone but hopefully his calf temporarely bothers him this weekend and he's limited.
-   **James Cook**: back to back 20 point weeks surely he's due for an underperformace sunday 4:25 in pittsburgh.
