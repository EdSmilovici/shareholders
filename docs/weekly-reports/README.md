# Week 14 - Quarterfinals

## Week 13 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

Wow what a rest week, we put up a lot of points and fielded a neat perfect roster, short by 2ish points. Just need a repeat this week against nedim again to make it to the semifinals of playoffs.

In other league news Nino was in fact not safe and devin edged him out of the playoffs with a monday night kicker puting up 20ish points to beat him out by less than a point. If he was mad that lamar jackson only put up single digit points when he faced us, i can only image how angry this made him. Cherry on top? he handed Julien his second win of the season.

## Pick ups and drops

➖ K. Boutte **WR** - NE

➕ C. Rodriguez **RB** - WAS

## Injury report

**Jayden Daniels** still injured at this point we might just be locked into dak and if we need to drop to pick up it might be him

**Drake London** out again, probably less likely to come back then Daniels but a bit more flexible in where we can put him, also for drop consideration as the season comes to an end

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

Late report so Bijan already put points up so love to him but nothing to watch

-   **Trey McBride**: Sunday 1pm facing off in houston let's hoppe for him to be the highest scoring TE this week (can't belive pits did me so dirty)
-   **Dak Prescott**: great performance last week, playing the sunday prime time game at 8:25pm against colins beloved vikings, please give us the blessing to cook Colin
-   **DK Metcalf**: idk fun name monday prime time at 8:20pm vs Miami let's hope it's cold and the dolphins freeze up against him

### Hate

Hating is back on the table boys starting with a bit of a random one:

-   **Las Vegas**: their offence faces off against out defence, fly birds fly, lets hope they do poorly and the eagles defence eats

Now for nedim's players:

-   **Trevor Lawrence**: Sunday 1pm he's been on of the biggest busts of a quarterback and lets hope he lives up to this this week.
-   **Derak Hendry**: Sunday 1pm a great running back we praying doesn't run much this week.
-   **Zay Flowers**: Sunday 1pm at the bengals, pray for low targets.

overall we need to lock in hate for 1pm sunday, a lot of the week will be determined for nedim then
