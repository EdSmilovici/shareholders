# Week 2

## Week 1 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

Week 2 was rough, can't believe wak dak outperformed Daniels, we'll have to see who has the better match up this week. Butler missed a 58 yard field goal, he better not miss any this week. Overall unfortunately our bench had 4 players that performed higher than their projections so our team is fine, just an unlucky week. Word on the street was the Shareholders consultant Jack Burnett was on vacation, it may be the reason our team fell apart.

Rumour on the street was that Leon was going to make Arian a heavy trade if he lost to the Shareholders this week. However, I’m sure his daily trades will continue now that he has gained a bit of confidence. If only we had Sean Evans to give us some football advice from his peewee days.

This week we are up against Michael D’Ettorre, who is frantically on the waiver wire trying to make pick ups to boost his projected score. I think the only pickups he really needs are the one he takes from shooting out of bounds on the greens. :golf:

### Trades

Michael (King Rexxcy) has apparently been trying to trade us, if you see him, mention that you can't believe he is trying to feece us with some terrible offers and that he might be worse than Mike and Leon.

## Pick ups and drops

None

## Injury report

**Jayden Daniels** did not practice wednesday or Thursday due to a knee issue, he's still expected to play Sunday but no need to stress Dak is always in our back pocket and is scheduled to play later so the decision can be made in the very last second

**Emeka Egbuka** also did not practice wednesday or Thursday, although he only has the questionable tag he's the most likely to last second be upgraded to out and sit out but we expect him to play.

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

Nobody's playing Thursday or Monday so we're only love watching Sunday.

-   **Devin Bursey**: i don't know, he texted me asking for a prayer in this weeks report and so here it is, he's play Julien so he shouldn't need it but with his star qb Toe Burrow being out for surgery he probably does need a hand :pray:
-   **Trey McBride**: Our starting tight end, he underperformed last week so we need him to do better this week or we might have to swap him out with Kraft on our bench.
-   **Bijan Robinson**: He put up 168 yeards last week lets home he can put even more up this week.

### Hate

Prime time hate watching, king rexxcy has stars playing Thursday, Sunday and Monday night.

-   **Patrick Mahomes**: Kansas City Quarterback has an easier matchup against the NY Giants but we can still pray for an underperformance. Sunday night 8:20 PM Prime time so lock in for some incomplete receptions.
-   **De'Von Achane**: Michael's second round pick is expected to put up 22 points, hopefully the buffalo defence can hold him back on Thursday night football.
-   **Jahmyr Gibbs**: Monday night we need him to run fewer than usual, last week he cleared 100 yards, this week lets see a max of 20 :joy:
