# Week 16 - Semiu=finals

## Week 15 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

Quite the nail biter last weeks matchup was up in the air until monday night with 1 player on oposite teams playing. Although we went into it ahead anything was possible. Fortunately DK Metcalf put up points late monday and even if the game was stressfull we cheered quite loud for what was a blow out game when DK scored.

This week we face off against King Rexxcy, we're going to need a little luck but this should be a good matchup.

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

-   **Bijon Robinson**: Sunday 4pm in Arizona let's cheer on our highest projected player to put up a record week.
-   **Dak Prescott**: Sunday 1pm LETS GO DAK SHOW US THAT MARGIC.
-   **Trevor McBride**: Sunday 4pm facing off against Bijon, we can just lock in and hope for a high scoring game.

### Hate

-   **Justing Herbert**: QB Faceoff he's playing against dak at 1pm on sunday, GO COWBOYS GO, today we pray for a cowboy blowout offence and defence
-   **Jahmyr Gibbs**: Sunday 4pm projected 25 we could really use an underperformace and there's plenty of room
-   **De'Von Achane**: Sunday 1pm projected 19 we're rooting against him versus the bengals.

Overall we're positioned for the finals with some good pick ups, just need to make it through this week and we win.
