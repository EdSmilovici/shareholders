# Week 1

Week 1 we're facing off against Tean Julienchicoine. Insider info sounds like we got really unlucky with this matchup, historically Julian forgets to set his line up and doens't maintain his team so this might be the week he is strongest. At the time of writing we are projected 10 points higher than Julian.

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

Most of our players play Sunday at 1:00 PM so that time will determine our week.

-   **Bijan Robinson**: Our first round pick a fresh all star Bijon is worth cheering for at 1pm vs Tampa Bay.
-   **Harrison Butker**: Picked in the 16th round he's who to cheer for on Friday, the game will be streamed for free on YouTube. Being the kicker we're hoping for some long ones friday!

### Hate

-   **Josh Allen**: Julien's Quarterback, we could really use him shitting the bed.
-   **Sequon Barkley**: Picked in the first round he's projected to put up 20 points Thursday night, let's hope the Dallas defence can hold him back from any long runs.
