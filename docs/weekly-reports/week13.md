# Week 13

## Week 12 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

Tough loss to the league number 1.

Mike and Leon are now going to have the same record as us but likely just a few fewer points scored so we should edge them out of the tie breaker.

I was wrong they're beating us out on tie break but leon's in hawaii for the week so hopefully he slips up this week.

Two teams will be one win fewer than us so we really need to lock in at least one more win in the last two matches to have a good chance at playoffs and if we win out we're a lock for playoffs.

## Pick ups and drops

## Injury report

**Jayden Daniels** i'm publishing this early so i really hope he's feeling better

**Drake London** same

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

Early report so maybe the active line up changes up but for now this is the list

-   **Daddy Dak**: I see he's currently in our active line up, after his great performace last week, let's see a repeat. Sunday 4:30 vs KC
-   **Bijan Robinson**: matched up against the Jets?! should be an easy point night, i actually have no clue how good the jets are doing this year but it usually safe to say they suck. Sunday 1pm @ NYJ
-   **Trey McBride**: projected for 18 let's see our star tight end put up some points Sunday 1pm at tampa bay.

### Hate

Early report so his lineup could change but after losing to Rexxy we can not lose to his dad Nino. Sorry

-   **Lamar Jackson**: Thursday night at Cincinnati, their record is poor but we need to lock in a low scoring game, hopefully lamar doesn't run as much as he usually does.
-   **McCaffrey**: sunday 1pm in cleveland, hate to wish injury on anyone but hopefully his calf temporarely bothers him this weekend and he's limited.
-   **James Cook**: back to back 20 point weeks surely he's due for an underperformace sunday 4:25 in pittsburgh.
