# Week 13

## Week 12 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

Sorry Nino but we needed that win, after a great performace by Dak Prescot we breezed into a clinched playoff spot. Other shout outs go to Bijan, McBride and RJ Harvey for our win.

I was told Nino was actually pretty unhappy until michael cooled him down and explained that he was so far ahead on points for that he'll get the 6th playoff spot.

Facing off against Nedim this week he is likely our round 1 playoff match up as awell so we need to lock in against him. The only scenario where we don't face him is if we win this week and Mike and Leon lose, in which case we face off against Nino again.

Overall a chill week for us as i'm not exactly sure who i'd rather face off in the playoffs

## Pick ups and drops

➖ R. Pearsall **WR** - SF

➕ K. Boutte **WR** - NE

## Injury report

**Jayden Daniels** he's designated as healthy but dak is definitely the move as long as the cowboys are still making a playoff push

**Drake London** out last week, still questionable, not sure when he'll be back, good thing this is pretty much a rest week for us

## Hate and Love Watch

-   **Trey McBride**: Sunday 4:25 let's cheer our tight end on.
-   **Bijan Robinson**: great performance last week, playing the seahawks at 1pm sunday, keep it up.
