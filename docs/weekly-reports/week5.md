# Week 5

## Week 4 Recap

### The Busted Gazette

Week 4 people, what a wild ride it’s been.

3.3 is the magic number etched into the ruler in Brian’s bedside table AND the number of points we BEAT Nino by 🥰🥰🥰 funny enough, it is also the number of seconds itll take Ed to find an aux cord at a party and play some Spanish chiquito. At least he doesn’t lock us in a car and explain what each song means 😂

So far this season has gone pretty well with 2 Wins and 2 Losses. Just like changing my daughter’s diaper, sometimes you just need to lock in and deal with the shit. I had practice listening to Brian’s dad jokes, so thankfully it has been easy for me. 😈🙊

Let’s refocus, we got a WIN!! I am a bit shocked though. Matt & Malia have rearranged their furniture more than our starting line up, and somehow we were able to squeak away with a W. I’d like to thank the Eagles for scoring 16 points and absolutely crushing Ninos spirits. I bet when he was watching that game he was sweating more than Ed on the dancefloor at any wedding. 💃 Rumour has it Nino was distracted this week posting pictures of his granddaughter on instagram without the mother’s permission 🙊

Speaking of mother’s permission, is that what we need for Ryland to finally lock Dak into starting position? This man is consistently performing everytime we put him on the bench!! Truly Dak is going the distance, but not as far as Ryland’s new commute to work at the airport. ✈️ 😤 Matt may have a hard time painting lips, but his lips have been speaking the good word about Dak and the shareholders need to listen 👂

Maybe I have trouble listening, because I don’t remember us taking advice from Andrew and rostering 3 quarterbacks. 😂 However, maybe it was Andrew who made the executive decision on the pick ups?? I just assumed there wouldn’t be strong enough wifi in the strip club or the casino 👀

Another great week for Cuk Chef & the Boys, let’s have another one next week ☝️

## Pick ups and drops

:heavy_plus_sign: M. Carter RB - ARI

:heavy_minus_sign: R. Doubs WR - GB

## Injury report

**Ricky Pearsall** hurt week 4 it's not looking like he'll have had enough time to recover for a Thursday night game.

## Hate and Love Watch

### Love

No thursday night players and just Butker on Monday.

-   **Jayden Daniels**: Back from his knee injury it's good to have our starting QB back, hopefully he puts up a safe amount of points.
-   **Trey McBride**: Our starting tight end, didn't quite get his projected 15 last week but surely he does this week and a few points ontop to make up for last week.
-   **Keenan Allen**: Only 8 points last week hopefuly he locks in and gets back to his 19 point form like the start of the season.

### Hate

With Nedim's defence on bye this week he'll have to make a move to fill that possition, other then that lock in on hate watching Mayfield and Henry.

-   **Nedim's Defence**: hopefully whoever he picks up puts up negative points 💕
-   **Baker Mayfield**: multiple interceptions please, he isn't the highest projected QB so lot's of room to mess up.
-   **Derrick Henry**: This is the scary one, he can put up massive numbers when he gets running, definitely worth watching.
